Topic:

Mortalities based on chronic diseases in the US, overtime and per state.

A review U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators from U.S. Department of Health & Human Services.

The questions we're asking of the data:

-Top causes of mortality per state

-# of mortalities reported per year

-demographic info per state

Interactive Visuals:

-Drop-down box to choose a state with resulting pie chart displaying top causes of mortality

-Line graph showing # of reported mortalities changing over course of 10 years


Process:

-search for data on chronic disease, download csv from data.gov (link below) after reviewing contents

-clean and filter the csv based on relevance and accuracy; blank fields or cases based on % or per 100,00 cases deleted. Lat and long parsed into seperate columns.

-Database and table created in postgresql to store csv.

-Flask and psycopg2 used in py file to run html on local server, and read the postgresql database into an api (json format).

-index.html is run through local server, displaying web page.

-logic.js files (1-3) populate interactive charts on web page by utilizing json data.
